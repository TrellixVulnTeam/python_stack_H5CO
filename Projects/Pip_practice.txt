running pip3 list was no different than running pip list with my virtual environmentactivated...

When I tried to install Django again, I was informed by my console that the requirement was already satisfied. :)

pip freeze displays the currently installed packages

an article on Medium.com states that running freeze > requirements.txt can be dangerous because it pollutes the dependancy list


what happens when I run ls inside of my desktop?

Django and Flask have a lot of files.
