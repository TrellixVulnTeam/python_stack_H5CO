	1.) How would you know if you have a circular linked list?
if self.head.last is self.foot AND self.foot.next is self.head


	2.) How would you get to the middle of the linked list?
run through the list with both a forward runner, and backward runner. 
define the middle of the list for odd, or even numbered list values


	3.) How would you remove duplicate values in the list?
memoize the whole list, and remove duplicate values based on the table OR
if memory is an issue, run an efficient program which searches the list 
multiple times to remove duplicate values.


	4.)How would you reverse the values in the list?
run through the list with a forward runner and a backward runner. swap values of next and last.
track events such as runner location, and runner colision
